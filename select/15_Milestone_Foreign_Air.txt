I left my bags in Georgetown
Over by the water
Walked right into the sound
Looking for a song to sing
It's all been building up to this, now
Its all been building up

This was a milestone for me
I wish you could see it
This was a milestone for me
Where were you this evening?
True colors came out
Flying high for all to see
This was a milestone for me
This was a milestone for me

Fireworks light up the sky, reflecting in the water
A strange time to say good bye
I look over my shoulder
And keep, keep thinking I
Keep, keep thinking I'm gonna see you (you)
But the truth starts sinking in, starts sinking in

This was a milestone for me
I wish you could see it
This was a milestone for me
Where were you this evening?
True colors came out
Flying high for all to see
This was a milestone for me
This was a milestone for me

Dig deep for your love
Dig deep for your love
I feel fine, but one day you're here, the next day you're gone

This was a milestone for me
I wish you could see it
This was a milestone for me
Where were you this evening?
True color came out
Flying high for all to see
This was a milestone for me
This was a milestone for me
