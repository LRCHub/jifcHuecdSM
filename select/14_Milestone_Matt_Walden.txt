It's when she walks in that door
And you look at her like it's the first time you've ever seen her
And your heart drops, and you are amazed
And you can't wait to tell all your friends about this girl
You can't wait to tell your mom about this girl
And you simply say to yourself
""This is her, this is the one""
That's love
In the moment that she walked in
Wanna know everything about her
Does she still talk with her father?
Or do they not speak anymore?
It's the cardinal sin
The things I think about her
Lusting two feet an hour
But I don't know which direction I'm heading in
Mmm, love
Maybe tonight we will stand alone
Because we are afraid of what's unknown
This could be our milestone
When I asked you to be my girl
I was nervous for your answer
And my heart started beating faster
Minutes turned to hours in my head
Six years have passed
I still think about that moment
Now you're the mother of the children that I'm holding
Mmm, love
Maybe tonight we won't stand alone
Because we aren't afraid of what's unknown
This could be our...
This could be our...
This could be our milestone
I'll still fight for you, even if we fight all night
We can make it through to see the morning light
And I'll still fight for you, even if we fight all night
We can make it through to see the morning light
I'll still fight for you, even if we fight all night
We can make it through to see the morning light
I'll still fight for you, even if we fight all night
We can make it through to see the morning light
This could be our...
This could be our...
This could be our milestone
In the moment that she walked in
I knew everything about her
She still talks with her father
And I know that I'm in love
